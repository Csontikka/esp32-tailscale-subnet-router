# Configuration reference

Every setting below is configured from the device web UI. Changes are
written to NVS; some require a reboot to take effect (the UI flags a
pending reboot when so).

> IP addresses, SSIDs and peer names shown in screenshots throughout the
> docs are generic placeholders.

## Network → Device-wide network

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Hostname** | Name advertised on the uplink network (DHCP/mDNS). |
| **DNS mapping TTL override** | `0` = off. Overrides the TTL the device applies to DNS-learned routes, for roaming continuity. |

## Network → Uplink networks (STA)

Up to **5** networks, tried in order. Per network:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **SSID** | Upstream 2.4 GHz network to join. |
| **Password** | WPA2/WPA3 PSK. Leave empty to keep the stored one. |
| **Static IP** *(optional)* | `ip` / `mask` / `gw` / `dns`; empty = DHCP. |
| **WPA2-Enterprise (EAP)** *(optional)* | Method, phase-2, identity/username/password, optional CA bundle. |

## Network → Access Point (AP)

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **AP SSID** | — | Network this device broadcasts. |
| **AP password** | — | WPA2 PSK; leave empty to keep current. |
| **Channel** | 6 | Shared with the STA radio; auto-realigns to the uplink channel. |
| **AP IP / Subnet mask** | `192.168.4.1` / `255.255.255.0` | The AP subnet. Changing it offers to update the advertised Tailscale route. |
| **DNS served to AP clients** | this device | Empty = the on-board forwarder; or push a specific resolver. |
| **On-board DNS forwarder** | on | Resolver + PSRAM response cache for AP clients. |
| **Forwarder upstream** | learned / `1.1.1.1` | Upstream resolver the forwarder queries. |
| **Hide SSID** | off | Stop broadcasting the SSID in beacons. |

## Network → DHCP, clients, denylist, port forwarding

- **DHCP reservations** — pin an IP to a MAC (max 16).
- **Connected clients / Active leases** — live tables with per-client signal.
- **Denied MAC addresses** — block specific clients from associating.
- **Port forwarding** — map an external port to an AP-side client.

## Tailscale

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | Master switch for the tailnet client. |
| **Auth key** | Tailscale auth key (`tskey-…`). Leave empty to keep current. |
| **Hostname** | Node name on the tailnet. |
| **Login server** | Custom control plane (Headscale). Empty = Tailscale. ⚠️ Headscale untested. |
| **Advertised subnet routes** | One CIDR per line; the AP subnet is offered automatically. |
| **Exit node** | Route AP-client public traffic through this tailnet exit node. Fails closed if unreachable. |
| **Max peers** | Upper bound on tracked peers. |
| **Accept peer subnet routes** | Install routes other nodes advertise. |
| **LAN bypass when using an exit node** | RFC1918 destinations stay on the local LAN even with an exit node selected. |

### Tunnel MTU

`Auto (peer-aware)` is recommended — it derives the effective MTU/MSS
from the active path (direct vs DERP, exit vs not). A fixed MTU can be
forced (576–1500) if a path misbehaves.

## Firewall

Four chains, **first match wins**; an empty chain allows by default.

| Chain | Direction |
|---|---|
| `TO_ESP` | Internet → ESP |
| `FROM_ESP` | ESP → Internet |
| `TO_AP` | Clients → ESP |
| `FROM_AP` | ESP → Clients |

Per rule: **source** / **destination** (`any` or CIDR), **protocol**
(Any / ICMP / TCP / UDP), **source/dest port** (`0` = any, TCP/UDP only),
**action** (Allow / Deny).

## System

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Device name** | Friendly name shown in the UI header and `/api`. |
| **Timezone** | Device TZ; a real change flags a pending reboot. |
| **Anonymous telemetry** | On by default; one toggle in the **About** card opts out. Daily anonymous hash + counters (see README → Telemetry). |
| **SD card logging** | Enable + per-sink (console / SD) log level; the on-device flight recorder. |
| **Firmware update (OTA)** | Manual upload or polled auto-install window. |
| **Encrypted backup / restore** | Export/import the full config, encrypted with a passphrase. |
| **Danger zone** | Reboot, factory reset, reset Tailscale identity. |
